# TIC_TAC_TOE

I bring you Tripple T... made with custom game board designs you can choose from...enjoy:)
<p>Oh and I added a splash screen because why not XD</p>

## INFO
- This program uses file-handling, the original game board is copied into a temporary text file which is modified as you play
and deleted when the game is over.
- The numbers on the board serve as placeholders and their locations are extracted and saved to memory to be used when the user points to
that location.

## POSSIBLE UPDATES

- Allow user to play against "bot"
- Create a level system 

## UPDATE LOG
