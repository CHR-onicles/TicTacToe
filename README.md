I bring you Tripple T... made with custom game board designs you can choose from...enjoy:)
<p>Oh and I added a splash screen to make it cooler XD</p>

## INFO
- This program uses file handling, the original game board is copied into a temporary text file which is modified as you play
and deleted when the game is over.
- The numbers serve as placeholders and their locations are extracted and saved to memory to be used when the user points to
that location.

## SCREENSHOTS
<img src = "images/board3.jpg" width = 700>
<img src = "images/board5.jpg" width = 700>
<img src = "images/board6.jpg" width = 700>

## POSSIBLE UPDATES
- Let players play multiple times without exiting(and add win ratio and stuff)
- Allow user to play against "bot"
- Create a level system 

### POSSIBLE PROBLEMS FOR LINUX USERS
- **system()** commands may not work properly on linux platforms i.e. **system("cls")**,**system("color 0b")**
so get windows and stop being a *noob* or change the commands to suit the platform XD
